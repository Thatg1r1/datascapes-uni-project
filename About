<p><h4><center>The story behind The Greenwich Archive</p></h4></center>
<div class="para2"><p>I began my project by walking around Greenwich Cutty Sark collecting visual data through photographs and video's. While walking around i found it interesting to see how different parts of Greenwich were more popular than others, tourists seemed to follow each other around, disregarding more rural places such as the Thames Walk. When i first moved to Greenwich i knew about the Cutty Sark but i was unaware of the boroughs history and thought it would be useful for other people to know more about what they saw.</p>
<p>I collected as many different types of data as i could to accomodate people with different requirements and ensure they leave the website with the knowledge and feeling of what it was like in Greenwich in 1770 and what it's like now.</p>
<P> By tightly focusing my project around Cutty Sark Greenwich i could accurately research the history of the area and create a sense of mapping a time travel.</p></div>
